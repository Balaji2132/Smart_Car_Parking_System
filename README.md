# Smart_Car_Parking_System

I have designed a smart car parking system which will display the free parking spots on to the users phone and LCD displays.
I have made the design on Proteus design 8.0 professional suite.
I have attached a zip folder which includes necessary library folders, python code, modules and etc. 
It also has a feature of deducting parking price from the NFC fastags placed on the vehicles.
